                            <p>Since last several decades it is observed that the technical education structure is unable to provide desired results. One of the major reason behind the same is commercialization of education where engineering and management institutes highly compromise with the quality of education and corporate requisite skill set. </p>
                            <p className="aicte_text5">As since last many years corporate requirement strategy changed a lot and hence it became really important that students must be provided with quality education and inculcated with corporate requisite skill sets. </p>
                            <p className="aicte_text5">How Institutes compromise with quality education can be very well understood by the below charts and graphs. The Graphs are taken from www.AICTE-India.organd available for public usage. </p>
