              <p>Education is one of the basic pillar of civic society which not only gives an individual a quality life however also makes him capable to contribute towards society and the Nation. Since last many decades it is found and also highlighted by many corporate identities that Indian Education system needs a complete transformation in order to meet future challenges and to create higher no of jobs and employment.</p>
              <p>As it can be very clearly seen from the data published by many government and private authorities that graduation, engineering and management institutes are failing drastically in their key responsibility as they only focus on rote learning without any practical, experimental and logical education which makes student completely clueless about his own career and at the same time completely unproductive for the corporates (Private or Government). </p>
              <p>An education cycle of every student is of 17-20 years that involves 12 years of schooling, 3-4 years of Graduation/engineering and 2 years of Post-graduation spending approx. 22 lacs or more. After spending the mammoth amount that is equivalent to 70% of lifelong earnings of a middle class Indian family a student is clueless about his career, have almost no skills for employment, have less self-esteem due to which many times a student also takes drastic steps. </p>
              <p>Sandhan learning is a training and development organization based on the system of providing education via technology via experiments and experience, which primarily focus towards development of students from schools and Universities. Founded on the principles of<span> Bharat Ratna Dr. APJ Abdul KalamSandhan</span> learning is focused on giving corporate requisite skills and knowledge by corporate experts related to specific domains.
