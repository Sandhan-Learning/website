                    <h3>Program Overview</h3>
                    <p>A student spends more than 16 years of his life in academics so that he/she could get a better career,
during the same time Indian parents spends almost 70% of their life time earnings towards education of
their children. It is a well-known fact that Indian education system does not provide industry requisite
skills due to which more than 75% of the students are either underemployed or unemployed. Data from
different Govt organizations including AICTE proves that more than 80% of Indian students are jobless
and career less after their Graduation. Engineering sector alone creates more than 2 million of
unemployed youth every year.
Chanakya is a strong bridge between institute and Industry where students not only learn requisite skills
from Industry experts but also provides them with 360 degree skill development with 360 degree
employment. The program focuses to develop students for Govt Jobs, Private jobs and entrepreneurship
under one platform and hence covers all the areas of employment.</p>

                    <h3>Why Institutes are unable to bridge the Industry Gap</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In India more than 95% lecturers/ teachers never worked with any business or corporate
organization either in Govt sector or in Private sector and hence do not have real time Industry
exposure. As they never worked and are not updated about the current market demand due to
which they either provide wrong information or half information to students. On the top of that
no one can have complete knowledge of every area of every sector until he/she worked on real
time.</li>
                         <li>Most of the Institutes in India are private funded and their only objective is to gain revenue or
getting business. As per NIRF (National Institutional Ranking framework) more than 90%
institution never participate in the ranking framework.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Why Chanakya is a complete career program</h3>
                    <p>During academics more than 99% of students are unaware of their true potential and were in search of
their right career. For example more than 5 Lac students from all across the country arrives KOTA and
take admissions in different IIT coaching institutes. Only 2500-3000 students get seats in different IITâ€™s
and rest 497,000 students either try one more time or are clueless about their career. Getting a seat in
IIT or medical is not going to solve the problem the main objective should be using the knowledge for
right cause.</p>
                    <p>At Sandhan we understand that Industry experts are the true bearers of absolute knowledge and
information. With the focus towards restructuring &amp; fine-tuning Indian education system and to make it
more result oriented, Chanakya is the only program in India which is designed in consultation with

specialists, Entrepreneurs, Business heads, R&amp;D specialists, operation heads, HR specialists, financial
experts and many more.</p>
                    <p>Designed with very high level of research &amp; philanthropic approach the program is based on the concept
of P2E2 model (Practical, Practice, Experiment and Experience) and hence develop 360 degree skills,
better learning environment &amp; opportunity with high level of Interest. The program is designed out of
experience instead of books and cater through 5 super modules with more than 200 sub modules that
covers requisite skill sets for Govt service, Private Service and Entrepreneurship.</p>
                    <p>The program is crafted with very high level of precession and perfect permutation and combination of
all the necessary skills and programs that helps students to develop 360 degree skills and to lead a
successful career &amp; life.</p>
