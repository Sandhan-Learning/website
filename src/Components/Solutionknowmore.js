In one of the Interview Dr. Kalam was asked about his perception towards national development, in reply Dr. Kalam responded that “Development of a country depends on 3 areas GDP, Economic structure and the Value system”.
</p>
<p>
    True education enables a person to utilize one’s mind, skills, thoughts, learnings and dreams in a systematic manner to achieve goals rather than being worried about unemployment and uncertainty of life and career.
</p>
<p>
    We at Sandhan learning believes that if GDP is low it can be recovered, if there is no economic structure or poor economic structure it can still be well structured, however if a country lacks with Value system the entire nation have to pay for the same. Japan is an excellent example of great value system. 
</p>
<p>
    At Sandhan learning we care for the nation and hence understand that education is the most powerful way to serve nation. True education not only empowers people to get or create employment however it also inculcate true leadership, critical thinking, value education and many more essential traits.
