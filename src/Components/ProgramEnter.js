                    <h3>Program Overview</h3>
                    <p>Entrepreneurship is not only dreams of many students however it also plays a vital role in countries
development. Entrepreneurs believes in creating wealth, jobs and opportunities. Every year more than
20 Lac student’s tries their luck in the field of entrepreneurship and more than 99.5% fails drastically in
their journey due to lack of knowledge related to management, technology, finance and many other
reasons. Entrepreneurship is also like any other career where a student can easily succeed when guided
and processed properly.</p>

                    <h3>The Academic Gap</h3>
                    <p>In Institutions Entrepreneurship development is taken too lightly. Almost every institute nowadays are
providing entrepreneurship development program. The programs in these institute are provided by
either some third party training organization or their own lecturers who never worked or tried hard in
entrepreneurship or are entrepreneurs. Imagine learning swimming from someone who himself don’t
know swimming.</p>
                     <p>The second reason is programs like Graduation, engineering or MBA are of 2 years to 4 years and
entrepreneurship development program is of 2 weeks. In conclusion the program which creates job
seekers is of 4 years and the program which creates jobs is of 2 weeks.</p>
