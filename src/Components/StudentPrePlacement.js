                    <p>In most of the Institutions Pre-Placement Training program is outsourced and is provided by any third
party vendor. It is observed that more than 99% trainers are not paid well and are struggling in their
own career. Similarly Aptitude is taken by someone who never cracked any compitative exams and
Interview skills is taken by someone who never cracked any real time Job interview or he/she was never
from the recruitment board of any reputed organization.</p>
