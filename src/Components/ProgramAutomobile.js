                    <h3>Program Overview</h3>
                    <p>Automobile and mechanical Industry is the biggest employment provider across the globe. The Industry is known as the blood line of economy of any country.

                    <p>While the Industry moved towards electrical vehicles and BS-6 technology the academic course structure still revolves around BS-3. As most of the educators who teaches mechanical engineering never worked with real time Automobile/mechanical Industry, they are not preoccupied with accurate knowledge, information and skills due to which students are unable to understand the Industry and their career inside the Industry as result students are unskilled with absolute wrong or no information.</p>
